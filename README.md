**Spider-Man is the story of Peter Parker, an ordinary high school student who gains superpowers after being bitten by a genetically modified spider. He discovers he has enhanced strength, agility, and the ability to cling to walls, as well as a "spidey sense" that warns him of danger. After a tragic mistake leads to the death of his beloved Uncle Ben, Peter learns the lesson that "with great power comes great responsibility." He dons the Spider-Man persona to fight crime and protect the city while balancing his personal life, school, and a complicated love interest in Mary Jane Watson. Along the way, he faces formidable villains like the Green Goblin, who tests his resolve and commitment to being a hero.**
